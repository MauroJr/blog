# Luke Gorrie's blog

Howdy!

My name is [Luke Gorrie](http://lukego.com/). I blog by creating [Github issues](https://github.com/lukego/blog/issues) in this repository.

I spend a lot of time hacking on [Snabb Switch](https://github.com/SnabbCo/snabbswitch) and that is the inspiration for most of my blogging.
